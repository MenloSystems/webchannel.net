# WebChannel.NET

## What is WebChannel.NET?

WebChannel.NET is an implementation of [Qt's WebChannel](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtwebchannel-index.html) protocol in C#/.NET.

This library only depends on [Newtonsoft's Json.NET library](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json).

Two versions of the library are built, one for .NET 3.5 and one for .NET 4.0. The latter build includes support for dynamic objects.
